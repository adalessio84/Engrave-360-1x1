# Engrave 360 1x1
## The plan
### Intro
Our plan is to create an engraver that can convert stl file and engrave it on a piece of steal. We will be using a 60 volts and a salt water vinegar combination to ionize steal to create our engravings. 
### Time frame
  - 11/8/2019
      - **Cad:** Have the assem Finished, Tested and ready to print.
      - **Electronics/Mechanical:Create AC to DC Transformer and step down to 60 volts. Also need to make sure that the liquid chaber is good**
      - **Coding: Ask max about his software to see if its viable**
  - 11/22/19
    - **Cad: have all parts printed out and working to fix mistakes if any** 
    - **Electronics/Mechanical:**
    - **Coding:**
